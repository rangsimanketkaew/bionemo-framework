# TransformerEngine-accelerated Llama 3 training for OpenGenome2

This folder demonstrates how to train TE-accelerated Llama 3 with a native PyTorch training loop for autoregressive DNA token prediction on the metagenome subset of the OpenGenome2 genomic dataset. It uses fully sharded data parallel (FSDP2), THD sequence packing, a custom nucleotide tokenizer, and supports FP32 master weights. Convergence has been validated against the Megatron/ShardedEden OpenGenome2 (OG2) baseline.

## Convergence Benchmarks (vs Megatron Baseline)

Our baseline is the Megatron/NeMo Llama 3 model trained with the Megatron ShardedEden dataloader. The
7B model uses Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with 32 attention heads and 8 key-value heads, matching
the configuration used by the reference Megatron baseline. To
improve convergence and training stability for the OG2 recipe, we adopted features used in the Megatron stack:
Spike-No-More embeddings, scaled initialization of output projections (proj/fc2), and BF16 compute
with FP32 master weights.

However, this recipe uses THD sequence packing for training, whereas the Megatron baseline uses a standard BSHD dataloader.
In the metagenome dataset, the median sequence length is ~2.2k and the average is ~4k, so with THD we
process roughly 2–3× more tokens per training step (less padding waste). See
[Dataset and tokenization](DATASET.md) for more details on the data pipeline. As a result, this recipe
achieves ~10% better average NLL loss and ~10% better perplexity on the test set than the Megatron baseline at a matched global batch size.
Both runs use FP32 master weights; the Megatron baseline uses FP8 training and we use BF16. Reported
results use GBS 384 on 6× H100 nodes (48 GPUs). Note that we also use bf16/fp32 training while the Megatron baseline uses fp8/fp32 training
which may also contribute to its lower test performance.

| Model                      | Step / checkpoint | Train loss | Mean Test loss | Mean Test Perplexity |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| LlaMA3 Recipe (OG2 7B)     | 182313            | 0.9444     | 0.9204         | 2.51                 |

### Tokenizer: BOS/EOS handling

The nucleotide tokenizer adds `<BOS>` and `<EOS>` to every window. During windowed tokenization,
each chunk of `max_seq_length` tokens is wrapped as `<BOS>...<EOS>`. Both BOS and EOS are excluded
from the loss by the genomic masking (they are not DNA tokens, so their labels are set to -100).

**Known difference from Megatron baseline:** The Megatron/ShardedEden dataloader places `<BOS>` and
`<EOS>` only at true sequence boundaries, whereas this recipe adds them to every window — including
interior windows of a long sequence. Since both tokens are masked from the loss, the impact on
training is minimal (especially for this dataset where most sequences are shorter than one window).
A future improvement could add special tokens only at true sequence start/end using
`add_special_tokens=False` with manual BOS/EOS insertion; HuggingFace does not support this
natively with strided tokenization.

For inference, use `add_special_tokens=True` to match training conditions. For sequences longer
than 8192 tokens, use a sliding window with 200-token overlap to match training, or use context
parallelism.

## Performance Benchmarks

### MFU formula (same as Llama3 70B benchmarks)

MFU was calculated using a 989 TFLOPS/GPU maximum theoretical bf16 throughput for H100. Model FLOPS use the formula:

```python
def compute_model_pflops(seq_len, global_batch_size, step_time_s):
    B, S, H, L, V = global_batch_size, seq_len, HIDDEN_DIM, N_LAYERS, VOCAB_SIZE
    model_flops = (
        (24 * B * S * H * H + 4 * B * S * S * H) * (3 * L) + (6 * B * S * H * V)
    ) / step_time_s
    return model_flops / 1e15
```

### MFU and step time (vs Megatron baseline)

| Model                | Step Time (s) | GBS | MFU (%) |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --- | ------- |
| This recipe (OG2 7B) | 6.60          | 384 | 51.8    |
| Megatron baseline    | 5.01          | 384 | 68.2    |

This recipe is ~32% slower per step than the Megatron baseline (6.60 s vs 5.01 s). The gap is
expected: the Megatron run uses FP8 and tensor parallelism (TP=4) which we do not yet enable.
Enabling FP8 and TP should close most of this gap. Step times are computed as the slope of
wall-clock time vs global step over a clean linear region.

### Throughput: THD vs BSHD

As seen in the table and chart below, using THD with our recipe provides ~80-85% improvement in the throughput (measured in the number of unpadded tokens) compared to BSHD.

| Config             | Unpadded Tokens/global batch | Unpadded Tokens/sec/GPU |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| THD (this recipe)  | 1,741,106                    | 9,927                   |
| BSHD (this recipe) | 3,145,728                    | 5,380                   |

## Installing Dependencies

The easiest way to get started is to use the provided Dockerfile, which uses an NVIDIA PyTorch base
image to provide optimized versions of PyTorch and TransformerEngine. To build the container, run:

```bash
docker build -t og2_llama_te .
docker run -it --gpus all --network host --ipc=host --rm -v ${PWD}:/workspace/bionemo og2_llama_te /bin/bash
```

Alternatively, the dependencies can be installed manually in an environment with CUDA support. See `requirements.txt`
for the list of dependencies.

## Key Settings for Improved Accuracy

### Megatron-Style Scaled Output Initialization

Residual output layers (attention `proj`, MLP `fc2`) use
`std = initializer_range / sqrt(2 * num_layers)` to match Megatron. Scaling by `1/sqrt(2*num_layers)`
keeps the residual branch variance stable across depth so that activations and gradients neither blow
up nor vanish when stacking many layers. This is controlled by `use_megatron_scaled_init` in Hydra
(default `true` in `hydra_config/defaults.yaml`). **Known bug:** scaled init does not work
correctly with meta device init; set `use_meta_device=false` when using scaled init or
Spike-No-More embedding init. See
[opengenome_modeling_llama_te.py](opengenome_modeling_llama_te.py) for implementation details.

### Weight Decay Parameter Skipping

We use weight-decay grouping that skips weight decay on biases, 1D parameters (e.g. LayerNorm/RMSNorm
weights), and optionally on embedding layers. Applying weight decay to embeddings can shrink their
norms and hurt representation quality; skipping it on biases and norm weights follows the Megatron
convention and avoids over-regularizing scale parameters. Controlled by `use_weight_decay_grouping`
and `skip_embedding_weight_decay` in Hydra (defaults: both `true`). See
[optimizer.py](optimizer.py) for `get_parameter_groups_with_weight_decay`.

### Spike-No-More Embedding Initialization

Embeddings are initialized with `std=1.0` instead of the usual small `initializer_range` (e.g.
0.02). The intuition is that a larger initial embedding scale avoids an early loss “spike” and
improves training stability ([Spike-No-More, arXiv:2312.16903](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16903)).
Controlled by `spike_no_more_embedding_init` in Hydra (default `true`). When enabled, we also set
`tie_word_embeddings=false` and skip embedding weight decay (see above). Use
`use_meta_device=false` when combining with Megatron scaled init.

### FP32 Master Weights and RoPE

when `use_fp32_master_weights` is enabled, we initialize the model in FP32 so that the master
weights are kept in FP32. Training uses BF16 parameters with FP32 gradient all-reduce via FSDP2 `MixedPrecisionPolicy`
(`param_dtype=bf16`, `reduce_dtype=fp32`). We also set `cast_forward_inputs=False` because the
default (`True`) would downcast RoPE embeddings — which are computed in FP32 in the model — to
BF16 at FSDP module boundaries, causing numerical issues in long-context attention. See
[train_fsdp2.py](train_fsdp2.py) for the policy setup.

## Distributed Training

This recipe supports distributed training using FSDP2 and FSDP2 with Context Parallelism, shown in
two separate training entrypoints:

- [Fully Sharded Data Parallel 2
  (FSDP2)](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.fsdp.fully_shard.html), shown in
  `train_fsdp2.py`
- FSDP2 with Context Parallelism, shown in `train_fsdp2_cp.py`

## Commands to Launch Training

To run single-process training on one GPU:

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity
```

To run multi-process training locally (e.g. 8 GPUs):

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 train_fsdp2.py --config-name og2_7b_thd_gqa
```

Multi-node example (e.g. 6 nodes × 8 GPUs):

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=6 --node_rank=$RANK \
    --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master_port=$MASTER_PORT \
    train_fsdp2.py --config-name og2_7b_thd_gqa \
    checkpoint.ckpt_dir=/output/checkpoints
```

Gradient accumulation is supported. Set `grad_acc_steps` to the number of micro-batches to
accumulate before each optimizer step (e.g. to scale effective batch size on fewer GPUs):

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 train_fsdp2.py --config-name og2_7b_thd_gqa grad_acc_steps=8
```

A tiny convergence/sanity config (`L0_sanity`) is available to overfit on a small dataset:

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity
```

### FP8 Training

To run training with FP8, enable it via the `fp8_config.enabled=true` override. Use the
`og2_7b_thd_gqa_fp8` config or override FP8 settings in your config:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 train_fsdp2.py --config-name og2_7b_thd_gqa fp8_config.enabled=true
```

FP8 debugging (stats collection for activations/weights/gradients) can be enabled with
`fp8_stats_config.enabled=True` and related options; see [fp8_debugging.py](fp8_debugging.py) and
the [Transformer Engine config
documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/debug/2_config_file_structure.html).

### Sequence Packing (THD input format)

Sequence packing is handled via a padding-free collator that provides inputs (e.g. `cu_seq_lens_q`)
for padding-free attention. Enable it with `use_sequence_packing=true` in the Hydra config. The
main OpenGenome2 configs use THD by default.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity use_sequence_packing=true
```

### Context Parallel Training

Context parallelism splits each sequence across multiple GPUs along the sequence dimension, enabling
training with very long sequences. Use `train_fsdp2_cp.py` with the `L0_sanity_cp` configuration and
set `cp_size` to the number of context parallelism ranks. Works with both BSHD (no padding) and
THD (padding) input formats. Only TE models are supported.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train_fsdp2_cp.py --config-name L0_sanity_cp cp_size=2
```

## Downloading Pre-Training Data

The default configs expect OpenGenome2-style data: either JSONL (e.g.
`data_metagenomics_train_*.jsonl.gz`) for streaming, or a directory of globally shuffled Parquet
shards. For details on the data pipeline, how to reshard your data with DuckDB, and the tradeoffs
between streaming approaches, see [Dataset and tokenization](DATASET.md).

Point `dataset.load_dataset_kwargs.path` to your data directory (or use the appropriate config).
Example for pre-chunked Parquet:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 train_fsdp2.py --config-name og2_7b_thd_gqa_global_shuffle \
  dataset.load_dataset_kwargs.path=/path/to/parquet_shards
```

## Saving and Loading Checkpoints

Set `checkpoint.ckpt_dir` to a writable directory. Checkpoint frequency is controlled by
`checkpoint.save_every_n_steps`:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 train_fsdp2.py --config-name og2_7b_thd_gqa \
  checkpoint.ckpt_dir=/output/checkpoints \
  checkpoint.save_every_n_steps=1000
```

To resume from the latest checkpoint, set `checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=true`:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 train_fsdp2.py --config-name og2_7b_thd_gqa \
  checkpoint.ckpt_dir=/output/checkpoints \
  checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=true
```

Set `checkpoint.save_final_model=true` to export a final model at the end of training (saved under
`final_model` in the checkpoint directory), suitable for Hugging Face Hub or local inference.

## Saving Dataloader State with StatefulDataLoader

Checkpointing can save and restore dataloader position when using the `StatefulDataLoader` from
`torchdata`. Enable it with `dataset.use_stateful_dataloader=true`. The save/load logic is in
[checkpoint.py](checkpoint.py); the dataloader instance is passed to `save_checkpoint_fsdp2` and
`load_checkpoint_fsdp2` so that resume continues from the correct step in the data stream.

## Performance Profiling with NVIDIA Nsight Systems

This recipe supports profiling with NVIDIA Nsight Systems. Enable it with `profiler.enabled=true`
and set `profiler.start_step` and `profiler.end_step` to define the step range to profile.
Profiling runs only on global rank 0 in distributed runs.

**Single GPU:**

```bash
nsys profile \
  -o nsight_trace \
  --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt,cudnn,cublas \
  --pytorch=autograd-nvtx \
  --capture-range=cudaProfilerApi \
  --capture-range-end=stop \
  python train_fsdp2.py profiler.enabled=true profiler.start_step=10 profiler.end_step=15
```

**Multi-GPU:** Wrap the same `python`/`torchrun` command with `nsys profile ...`; only rank 0
will profile. See [perf_logger.py](perf_logger.py) and the [Nsight Systems
documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/).

## Running Inference with the Trained Model

Models can be loaded from the final checkpoint directory using `AutoModelForCausalLM` or
`NVLlamaForCausalLM` from this recipe. Standard Hugging Face loading works if `config.json` is
updated to include an `auto_map` entry for `opengenome_modeling_llama_te.NVLlamaForCausalLM` and
the custom forward pass is packaged in the checkpoint directory. Use
`add_special_tokens=True` when tokenizing input sequences to match training (the model was
trained with `<BOS>` and `<EOS>` on every window).

If you trained with TE layers (which is the default), use `NVLlamaForCausalLM` for inference with
TE’s `InferenceParams` key-value cache:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformer_engine.pytorch.attention import InferenceParams
from opengenome_modeling_llama_te import NVLlamaForCausalLM, NVLlamaConfig

# Load the model configuration and weights
config = NVLlamaConfig.from_pretrained("path/to/final_model")
model = NVLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/final_model", config=config)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./tokenizers/nucleotide_fast_tokenizer")

model.to("cuda")
model.eval()

# Example genomic sequence
sequence = "ACGTACGT"
inputs = tokenizer(sequence, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

# Setup inference parameters for efficient generation
past_key_values = InferenceParams(
    max_batch_size=1,
    max_sequence_length=256,
    num_heads_kv=model.config.num_key_value_heads,
    head_dim_k=model.config.hidden_size // model.config.num_attention_heads,
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    qkv_format="thd",
    max_ctx_len=256,
)
for layer_number in range(1, model.config.num_hidden_layers + 1):
    past_key_values.allocate_memory(layer_number)

# Generate
with torch.no_grad():
    output_ids = model.generate(
        **inputs, max_new_tokens=16, use_cache=True, past_key_values=past_key_values
    )

generated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
```

### Converting to Hugging Face Format

To convert the trained TE model to a standard Hugging Face `LlamaForCausalLM` (e.g. for vLLM or
SGLang), you can use the conversion script in the parent Llama3 models directory
(`../../models/llama3/convert.py`) if the model layout matches. Load with `NVLlamaForCausalLM` and
`NVLlamaConfig` from this recipe, then call `convert_llama_te_to_hf(model_te)` and save the
resulting model and tokenizer.

## Hydra Configs

| Config                          | Description                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `og2_7b_thd_gqa`                | Main 7B GQA config; streaming JSONL, windowed tokenization |
| `og2_7b_thd_gqa_global_shuffle` | Pre-chunked Parquet shards (globally shuffled)             |
| `og2_7b_thd_gqa_fp8`            | FP8 variant with Float8BlockScaling                        |
| `L0_sanity`                     | Tiny model for CI/CD testing                               |

See [hydra_config/defaults.yaml](hydra_config/defaults.yaml) for all options.

## Evaluating Checkpoints

To compute per-sequence test loss on a fixed FASTA file (for comparing checkpoints or models):

```bash
cd scripts
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 evaluate_fasta_lm_loss.py \
    --checkpoint-dir /path/to/checkpoint \
    --checkpoint-step 30000 \
    --fasta metagenomics.fasta \
    --output /path/to/results.json
```

This computes per-token log probabilities for each sequence in the FASTA file, masks degenerate
bases, and reports per-sequence and aggregate metrics (CE loss, perplexity). Results are saved as
JSON for easy comparison across runs. See `scripts/evaluate_fasta_lm_loss.py` for full usage.

## Validation Logging

Validation logging during training can be enabled with `validation.enabled=true` and `validation.data_path` pointing to
validation data (e.g. a JSONL file). The `og2_7b_thd_gqa` config enables validation by default.
Control evaluation frequency with `validation.eval_interval` and `validation.num_batches`.This can be helpful when debugging training convergence.
