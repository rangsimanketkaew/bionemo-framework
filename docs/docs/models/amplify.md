## Model Overview

Training code for this model is in
[`recipes/esm2_native_te`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/bionemo-framework/tree/main/recipes/esm2_native_te)
and
[`recipes/esm2_accelerate_te`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/bionemo-framework/tree/main/recipes/esm2_accelerate_te);
use an AMPLIFY model tag such as `nvidia/AMPLIFY_120M`. Use
[`models/amplify`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/bionemo-framework/tree/main/models/amplify)
for checkpoint conversion and model implementation details.

### Description

A TransformerEngine-optimized implementation of the [AMPLIFY model](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.614603v1),
a protein language model variant of ESM-2 with modified layer structure and dataset construction. The model is designed
for protein sequence understanding and prediction tasks, with variants available at 120M and 350M parameter sizes.

This model is ready for commercial use.

### Third-Party Community Consideration

This model is not owned or developed by NVIDIA. This model has been developed and built to a third-party's requirements
for this application and use case; see the [Chandar Lab website](https://chandar-lab.github.io/).
