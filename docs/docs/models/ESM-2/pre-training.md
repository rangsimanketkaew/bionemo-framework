# Pre-training ESM-2

Pre-trained checkpoints for ESM-2 are available at the 8M, 650M, and 3B model sizes. These models were trained by the
BioNeMo Recipes team to reproduce the original training results from Lin et al., Science (2023), with more recent
UniProt data and leveraging the BioNeMo training infrastructure. The full [pre-training data](../../main/datasets/uniprot.md)
and train/test splits are available.

## Training with BioNeMo Recipes

Active ESM-2 training code lives in
[`recipes/esm2_native_te`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/bionemo-framework/tree/main/recipes/esm2_native_te).
See the recipe README for setup instructions, supported training scripts (`train_ddp.py`,
`train_fsdp2.py`), and benchmark results.

An Accelerate-based variant is also available at
[`recipes/esm2_accelerate_te`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/bionemo-framework/tree/main/recipes/esm2_accelerate_te).

## Model Convergence

Validation perplexity evaluated on the NVIDIA validation set.
